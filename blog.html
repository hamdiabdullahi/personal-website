    <h2 id="one"> HUMOUR IN BORN A CRIME</h2>

    <p class="smry">Humour is displayed by Trevor in many parts of the book whereby he used his humour to escape so many
        difficult
        situations.We can see humour where he said “i know you love Jesus, but maybe next week you could ask him to meet
        us at our
        house”.He wanted to make his motherto laugh and break the hard day’s stress and also he was againstgoing to
        church all the
        time.Trevor happens to put a smile at hismom’s face whenever hardship crops their life.There was humor inthe
        part whereby
        some African men wanted to steal from him and he understood their language surprisingly he added into it by
        saying Yo guys
        why dont we just mug someone together?,am ready, let's do it. ”This shocked them and they started laughing.His
        sense of
        humor savedhim from them stealing from him.Not everyone can think that quickly and create humour in such a
        situation.The
        most laughter moment in the novel was whereby he had to shit inside the house and try to pretendall is well and
        act innocent.
        He was even the one leading the prayers for”chasing demons” knowing what he did.He was pretending to pray hard
        but again he
        says”we don't know what happened maybe it's a big misunderstanding”.Here he was just defending himself.
        Trevor is so friendly with his mother such that in the letter writing process he could address his mom so rude
        in humorous way.There is this part where he said "..why will i be good at school because genetically we are the
        same.”He tells his mom that when she asked him why he is not doing well in school.He also added that he is  
        naughty because he inherited it from her too that sounded funny. Trevor makes every moment laughable even when
        he is beaten by his principal he starts laughing and this makes the principal angry and asks his mom to go and
        check if her son needs a psychologist. Being beaten and laughing is just not a funny thing but to him he just
        thought like”man,if only my mom hits me like this.There was a humour in the part whereby he took his girlfriend
        to the party and she refused to come out of the car he called the boys in the party and everyone laughed at
        him.The point where he couldn't know the language his girlfriend spoke made me laugh.There is also humour in the
        part whereby he could convince some mothers and they will allow him to hang around at their homes as he books a
        date for their daughters and exchange it with money When his friend Teddy got arrested after both of them were
        caught stealing from ashop,Trevor happens to run and disappear but his friend is caught up.When the police asks
        him in school office with the video captured displayed Trevor happens to say in his mind”can you not see that is
        me!,are you people blind?”Trevor's character is what made the whole book enjoyable.

    <h2 id="one">TRADITIONAL MAN(ABEL)</h2>
    <p class="smry"> Traditional man,Abel is clearly portrayed as the traditional man his behaviours and characters tend
        to show
        how African men love to lower women to the lowest degree.We can see Patricia advising her son Trevor about being
        a g
        entleman"Trevor,remember a man is not determined by how much he earns.You canstill be the man of the house and
        earn less
        than your woman.Being a man is not what you have ,it's who you are.Being more of a man doesn't mean your woman
        has to be
        less than you."She clearly says that out of bitterness buthardly expresses it to her son because he is too young
        for that.
        She tells him all that because she wants him to know the value of women.She asks for recognition from him
        because she hardly
        gets it from her husband Abel. Abel assumes her and doesn't have some good time with her Abel made Patricia to
        bow for him
        when they went to his family.He made her do what people back at their home do he clearly showed her that women
        are not
        supposed to sit in the same table with men.Patricia never cared all she did was do what makes her happy and her
        inlaws
        were so upset.Patricia was independent woman at first but Abel happened to put her in a cage.All he wanted her
        to have
        control over her life.A traditional man won't allow woman to be ahead of him.Now that he got all he wants from
        her why
        not free her? Like he has no sign of being grateful at all.His wife makes all the efforts in the world to build
        him but
        all he does is bring her down.Leaving her job just to boost his business by keeping everything for him was never
        enough
        for him. Abel could fail to repair her car so that she doesn't go out and have some fun with her son or even go
        to her
        work.He uses that as an effective tool to count her movements because it's him who will be driving her.There was
        a time
        he even smacked her and almost burnt the whole family just because he was drunkard.Abel doesn't see that a huge
        problem
        and he keeps on arguing with her.The worst part was whereby Patricia went to the police station to seek help
        because
        Abel has beaten her and all they do was to assume it like its normal for that they regarded all that something
        known
        for them.Patricia lost her way the only thing she had was Abel she forgot about her son.When Trevor's life
        became
        hard he had to go and live all by himself because his mother was in a cage and she can't help him the way she
        used to
        do.It's too ironic how traditional men choose women who are well educated,who wants to build them instead of
        contributing to her growth too they misuse and make her feel unappreciated. </p>
